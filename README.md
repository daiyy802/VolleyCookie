VolleyCookie
============

Example using volley saving cookie


1 - Import `volley.jar` from libs path to your project

2 - Import `compile group: 'org.apache.httpcomponents' , name: 'httpclient-android' , version: '4.3.3'` in your build.gradle dependencies

This is not my own whole code. I just needed something like this and I wrote some codes from stackoverflow.
